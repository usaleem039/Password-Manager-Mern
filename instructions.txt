Overall Structure:

Functionality: 
The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and copy passwords, which is the core functionality expected in a password manager. The use of localStorage for persistence is a good choice.


State Management: 
You're using the useState and useEffect hooks effectively for managing form state and handling side effects (like loading passwords from localStorage).


UI Feedback: 
Using react-toastify for notifications enhances the user experience by providing feedback on actions.
